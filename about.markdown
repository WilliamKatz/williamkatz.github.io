## Hi, my name is Billy Katz and I am a game designer.

      I am interested in building meaningful games that help players express themselves and connect with the world around them. This portfolio showcases my ability to manage and ship personal projects, collaborate effectively with teammates at commercial studios, and my general curiosity in game design.

## Professional Experience 

### Good Luck Games

     <div style="flex:2">

<b>Unity Software Engineer, June 2022 - Present</b>
<div class="small-empty-div"></div>
        As a software engineer at Good Luck Games, I built out client features like in-game news and emote selection.  I also partnered with the art director to design and implement a modular VFX library.  With the improved tools, artists were able to create an effect once and use it across multiple VFX.

      <h3>Shift Shaft</h3>
Shift Shaft is a strategic match-3 roguelike that adds a mind-bending spin on a classic genre by allowing players to rotate the board. It is easy to pick up and play and difficult to master. 
<div class="med-empty-div"></div>
<blockquote style="color:#178585;">
   “What really blew my mind with Shift Shaft and the main thing that makes it feel unlike any other game out there is your ability to rotate the entire board at will. It sounds simple but this changes everything… This is truly a thinking person’s matching game.”

      <h3>Thin Ice</h3>
      <i>Thin Ice</i> is a deckbuilder with tactical movement where players control a puffin on their mission to rid the Arctic of pollutants.  <i>Thin Ice</i> is unique because players draw from two decks and the cards are then merged into a single card in the player's hand.  Deckbuilders often overload the player with rules, keywords, and icons to memorize but in <i>Thin Ice</i> cards are simple.  The movement cards are arrows and the modifier cards are simple math operations like "+1" and "x2".

      <h3>Mycelia</h3>
      <b> University of Washington's Tri-Campus Game Jam, 2021</b>
      <div class="small-empty-div"></div> 
      In <i>Mycelia</i>, players control a fungal network in a real-time strategy game to revive a once-thriving forest.  Players use action points to connect hexes to the central Mother Tree to share resources and attempt to make it through the grueling summer. 
      <div class="med-empty-div"></div>
      I designed the tiles to be color-blind accessible and programmed the action point system and tutorial.

      <h3>Bombs Away</h3>
      <b>University of Washington Game Jam, 2020</b><br>
      <div class="small-empty-div"></div> 
      Who needs shovels? In this <i>Worms</i> inspired puzzle adventure players use bombs to find buried treasure left behind by the famous pirate Black Beard. On their quest, players spend coins to upgrade their bombs so they can blow up bigger swaths of land.
      <div class="med-empty-div"></div>
      I programmed the destructible terrain maps, tutorial, main menu, and the gameplay.  I also taught our level designer how to build maps with tools I created.
