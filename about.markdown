      I am interested in building meaningful games that help players express themselves and connect with the world around them. This portfolio showcases my ability to manage and ship personal projects, collaborate effectively with teammates at commercial studios, and my general curiosity in game design.

## Professional Experience

<b>Unity Software Engineer, June 2022 - Present</b>
<div class="small-empty-div"></div>
        As a software engineer at Good Luck Games, I built out client features like in-game news and emote selection.  I also partnered with the art director to design and implement a modular VFX library.  With the improved tools, artists were able to create an effect once and use it across multiple VFX.

      <h3>Shift Shaft</h3>
Shift Shaft is a match-3 roguelike where players can rotate the board.  Players move their character around the board by destroying rocks and rotating to change gravity.  But watch out because monsters lurk behind every corner!
<div class="med-empty-div"></div>
<blockquote style="color:#178585;">
   “What really blew my mind with Shift Shaft and the main thing that makes it feel unlike any other game out there is your ability to rotate the entire board at will. It sounds simple but this changes everything… This is truly a thinking person’s matching game.”

      <h3>Coffee Shop Clues</h3>
<i>Coffee Shop Clues</i> is a cozy drink-crafting game where you play as an aspiring witch barista setting up her new cafe. You'll need to whip up custom drinks to satisfy customers, but they only provide vague hints about what they want. Will that be a steaming "Pumpkin Spice Batte" potion for sweet dreams or a "Transylvania Fog" to conjure some cheer? Combine coffee elements however you see fit to make the townspeople happy in this spooky soft opening.

      <h3>Thin Ice</h3>
In the deckbuilding game <i>Thin Ice</i>, players take on the role of a puffin on a mission to clean up the Arctic. What makes this game unique is its dual-deck system - you draw cards from two separate decks, then merge them to form a single card in your hand. This innovative mechanism streamlines the typical complexity of deckbuilders. Instead of numerous keywords and icons to memorize, your cards are simple: movement cards just show arrows, while modifier cards have basic math operations like "+1" and "x2." Thin Ice offers all the strategy of a deckbuilder in a fun, accessible package.

      <h3>Mycelia</h3>
      <b> University of Washington's Tri-Campus Game Jam, 2021</b>
      <div class="small-empty-div"></div> 
      In <i>Mycelia</i>, players control a fungal network in a real-time strategy game to revive a once-thriving forest.  Players use action points to connect hexes to the central Mother Tree to share resources and attempt to make it through the grueling summer. 
      <div class="med-empty-div"></div>
      I designed the tiles to be color-blind accessible and programmed the action point system and tutorial.

      <h3>Bombs Away</h3>
      <b>University of Washington Game Jam, 2020</b><br>
      <div class="small-empty-div"></div> 
      Who needs shovels? In this <i>Worms</i> inspired puzzle adventure players use bombs to find buried treasure left behind by the famous pirate Black Beard. On their quest, players spend coins to upgrade their bombs so they can blow up bigger swaths of land.
      <div class="med-empty-div"></div>
      I programmed the destructible terrain maps, tutorial, main menu, and the gameplay.  I also taught our level designer how to build maps with tools I created.
