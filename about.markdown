# Hi my name is Billy Katz and I am a game designer. 

I am interested in building meaningful games that help players express themselves and connect with the world around them. This portfolio showcases my ability to manage and ship projects, collaborate effectively with teammates across disciplines, and my general curiousity in game design. 

## Shift Shaft 
### Now available on the iOS App Store
[Shift Shaft](./shift-shaft) is a match-3 strategic puzzle game where players can rotate the board. It's easy to learn and difficult to master and it's out now. [Available here.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shift-shaft/id1387207777)



<!-- [Meowsterminds](./meowsterminds) is a cooperative party game where 3-6 players control a criminal crew of cats to pull off elaborate heists. -->

## Game Jams
In, [Mychorriza](./game-jams) you grow a fungal network, share resources and cull deadweight in an attempt to save the Mother Tree.

[Bombs Away](./game-jams) is Worms meets Treasure Island. Use bombs to blow up the ground and uncover treasures. Trade that loot for bigger bombs and see if you can find Black Beard's coffers.
