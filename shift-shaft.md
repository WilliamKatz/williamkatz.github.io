Players take control of a miner who must navigate through mineshaft to fight monsters, collect gems, and try to escape.  Most attempts end in failure, but that's okay, everytime the player dies the Mineral Spirits which them back to Basecamp where they can upgrade their character and try again.  Players unlock better and better upgrades over time that bolster their stats like health, dodge, and luck and increase the power of the items they can find in the mines.
