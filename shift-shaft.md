Shift Shaft is a turn-based match-3 roguelite, where the player navigates the mineshaft to fight monsters, collect gems, and try to escape the mines.  After each playthrough, players have the chance to upgrade their base character and improve their chances in the mines.  The further the player digs the more of the story unfolds.  At first, they think they are an human orphan who just happens to be an excellent miner.  But soon, they learn that they are the last chance to save their dwarven family. Players will need to hone their strategy and just a little bit of luck to defeat the gem-eating spider and save their family.  

It will be available on {{ page.release-date }} on iOS and iPadOS in the App Store.  

### Simple to play, hard to master
Shift Shaft is an approachable game that looks like a pixelized Bewjeled.  However, it puts a fresh spin on many match-3 games by allowing the player to rotate the board. This simple mechanic adds a layer of deep strategy that makes the game east to play, yet difficult to master.  

### Find yourself in the mine
Player are represented in the game as an avatar on the board.  Players can move their avatar by mining away rocks with a tap of the finger and rotating the board with a swipe gesture.  When the players makes it to the mineshaft exit they advance to the next level.  However, there are also many monsters with unique attack patterns that are trying to stop the player.  As the player gets deeper and deeper in to the mine they learn more and more about their history and the true fate of their parents and family.
