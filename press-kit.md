# Shift Shaft
Shift Shaft is a strategic match-3 puzzle game that adds a mind-bending spin on a classic genre by allowing players to rotate the board.  This simple mechanic creates endless complexity and makes Shift Shaft enjoyable for newcomers and veterans alike. In addition to the rotation mechanic, players control a miner that is in the board itself and can only move by tapping away rocks and rotating the board. Players complete level objectives to unlock the exit and move to attack or avoid monsters.

Most runs end in failure but that's okay beacuse the Mineral Spirits resurrect the player at Basecamp.  At Basecamp, players can upgrade their stats and improve their item pool with new and powerful items. 

The game culminates in an intense boss fight with a gem-eating spider.  This fight tests the player's skills, ingenuity and overall mastery of the game, do you have what it takes?
