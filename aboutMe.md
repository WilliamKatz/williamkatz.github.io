## Billy Katz
Hi, I am a game developer with a passion for deckbuilders and roguelikes.  In 2020, I quit my job at Amazon because I knew I wanted to be a game developer. In 2022, I released my first game and landed my first industry job at Good Luck Games.  I work mostly in game design and programming but I also love creating VFX and tinkering with hand drawn animations. 

### Ultimate Frisbee
I am a two time National Champion and two time World Champion in ultimate frisbee.  I have played since 2010 and I compete with my club team "Mixtape" based in Seattle, WA. I have also played on the USA National Team at the World Beach Frisbee Championships.  

I love Ultimate Frisbee because the game is self-refereed which means the players on the field make the calls.  This means that players value integrity and treat one another with respect and dignity. 

### Favorite birthday celebration
My favorite way to celebrate my birthday is to cook a huge meal for my friends. I am Filipino-American and I connect with my heritage by cooking traditional foods like adobo, sinigang, pancit, kaldereta, pinakbet, and garlic fried rice. 

### If I'm not playing a game...
Then I am probably cooking dinner, clamming at a local beach, or sitting outside with friends.

### If I were Stranded on a desert island and could bring 1 book, 1 movie, 1 album, what would they be?
**Ancillary Justice**.  I really love how Ann Lecke writes about gender and I love the idea of an AI holding a grudge forever.


**My Cousin Vinny**.  Every single scene is hilarious and the New York accent makes me feel like I am home.


**Aja by Steely Dan**.  My dad was a huge influence on me and my musical tastes and now I love jazz and funk music and Aja is a beautiful combination of both.


### Favorite Boardgame
Right now, my favorite game is Wingspan. Wingspan combines intriguing engine-building mechanics, beautiful artwork, balanced strategies and it a great two player game.  Recently, I have started to love "The Lost Ruins of Arnak" and it is quickly becoming my next favorite boardgame.

### Favorite PC game 
Storybook Brawl is an incredible autobattler that challenges the player to compose an army of fairytale characters.    

### Favorite Mobile game
Isle of Arrows.  This game combines base building with tower defense and it reminds me of what good old fashioned mobile gaming used to be.
