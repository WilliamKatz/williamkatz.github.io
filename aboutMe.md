## Billy Katz
Hi, I am a game developer with a passion for deckbuilders and roguelikes.  In 2020, I quit my job at Amazon because I knew I wanted to be a game developer. In 2022, I released my first game and landed my first industry job at Good Luck Games.  I work mostly in game design and programming but I also love creating VFX and tinkering with hand drawn animations.

### Ultimate Frisbee
I am a two time National Champion and two time World Champion in ultimate frisbee.  I have played since 2010 and I compete with my club team "Mixtape" based in Seattle, WA. I have also played on the USA National Team at the World Beach Frisbee Championships.  

I love Ultimate Frisbee because the game is self-refereed which means the players on the field make the calls.  This means that players value integrity and treat one another with respect and dignity.

### Favorite birthday celebration
My favorite way to celebrate my birthday is to cook a huge meal for my friends. I am Filipino-American and I connect with my heritage by cooking traditional foods like adobo, sinigang, pancit, kaldereta, pinakbet, and garlic fried rice.

### If I'm not playing a game...
Then I am probably cooking dinner, clamming at a local beach, or hiking with friends.

### If I were stranded on a desert island and could bring 1 book, 1 movie, 1 album, what would they be?
**Ancillary Justice**.  I really love how Ann Lecke writes about gender and I love the idea of an AI holding a grudge forever.


**My Cousin Vinny**.  Every single scene is hilarious and the New York accent makes me feel like I am home.


**Aja by Steely Dan**.  My dad was a huge influence on me and my musical tastes and now I love jazz and funk music and Aja is a beautiful combination of both.

### Favorite Boardgame
**Wingspan**. It combines intriguing engine-building mechanics, beautiful artwork, balanced strategies and it a great two player game.  

### Favorite PC game 
**Storybook Brawl**. I love the way it challenges players to strategically build a composition of famous fairy tale characters.  It has an incredibly satisfying power curve and when you plan and get the right cards, everything falls into place.    

### Favorite Mobile game
**Isle of Arrows**.  This game combines base building with tower defense and it reminds me of what good old fashioned mobile gaming used to be.
